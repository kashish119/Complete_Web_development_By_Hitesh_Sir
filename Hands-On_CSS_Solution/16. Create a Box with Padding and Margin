        Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.Iâ€™m a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.Everything you've ever wanted is sitting on the other side of fear.
